        <h3>Fullstack JavaScript Developper</h3>
        <p>
          I was one of the core developper of the webapp Findout, a keywords-based search engine.
          This webapp is a Angular frontend talking to many NodeJS APIs. They all had their dedicated database.
          Each API is hosted on a virtual debian server, contained into one big cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed the architecture of the Node APIs, in order to have one reusable code base for all of our APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implemented several frontend pages, with E2E tests (using protractor), an essential tool for stablity.
