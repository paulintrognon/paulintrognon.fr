        Full rewrite of the tracking system, a simplified CRM, in PHP 5.4
      </p>
      <p>
        The old version was an incredibly messy spagetthi code, with tons of code duplication and dead code.

        I hosted french and american versions of the Leon Paul websites on to dedicated RedHat servers.
